# GRAMMABLE

###Overview
All the kids love grams. Instagram being the primary gram flavor.

This project took a TDD approach and ended up with a slew of controller tests.
Take a look at the tests [here](https://github.com/danielpowell4/grammable/tree/master/spec/controllers).

Users are able to create accounts through Devise and upload images leveraging
AWS and CarrierWave. Users can add grams and comments through SimpleForms.

###See in the Wild
You can view the app by pulling it down, and firing up a rails server.
**Disclaimer:** For full functionality you'll need to add an application.yml file with relevant AWS S3 keys

As of Sept 8, 2016, you can also check it out [on heroku](https://grammable-dan-pow.herokuapp.com/)!
